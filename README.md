# Hermes Conduit

A native iOS client for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent). Free, no ads, no tracking.

## What it does

Conduit connects directly to your self-hosted Hermes dashboard. Same sessions, same profiles, same capabilities as the desktop client. No relay service, no extra processes, no middleman.

Start a conversation on desktop, pick it up on your phone. The session list is the same because it is the same database.

## Features

**Chat**

- Streaming responses with full Markdown — syntax-highlighted code, math, Mermaid diagrams, task lists
- Tool call inspection, reasoning traces, and delegated-agent progress
- Image, PDF, and text attachments, or paste an image straight into the composer
- Steer or interrupt an active turn mid-flight
- Context usage meter with token counts and a progress ring
- Slash commands and workspace file browsing
- Session branching, pinning, archiving, refresh, and delete

**Voice**

- Push-to-talk voice mode with on-device speech recognition or server-side Whisper
- Live voice conversations via GPT-Live (OpenAI Realtime) and Gemini Live, including web search through Gemini's tool bridge
- CarPlay support — talk to Hermes from the car
- Spoken stop/end commands, continuous-conversation controls, and background audio

**Agents and control**

- Bot Mode — browse your Hermes bots and open their dedicated Bot Chat conversations
- Multiple dashboards — save and switch between Hermes servers with isolated credentials, sessions, and connection state
- Provider and model switching without leaving the conversation, plus reasoning effort controls
- Capabilities tab to toggle skills, tools, and MCP servers
- Scheduled jobs viewer, connector monitoring, and recent gateway logs
- Multi-profile support with per-profile settings

**Sign-in, notifications, platform**

- Native OAuth sign-in for dashboards using Google or other OIDC providers
- Cloudflare Access service-token support
- Push notifications for approvals, input requests, completed responses, failed turns, and background tasks
- Inline approvals so you can approve or reject tool calls without typing
- Face ID lock and Keychain credential storage
- iPhone and iPad (iOS 17+)
- Simplified Chinese localization

## Requirements

- iOS 17 or later
- iPhone or iPad
- A running Hermes Agent instance with the native dashboard enabled (default port 9119)

## Connecting

1. Make sure your Hermes dashboard is running. If you are not sure, ask your agent: `is the dashboard running?`
2. Find your dashboard address. It is usually `http://your-server-ip:9119`.
3. Open Conduit and enter that address on the login screen.
4. Log in with your dashboard credentials.

**Note:** Conduit connects to the native Hermes dashboard, not the WebUI. The default port is 9119.

If your server is not on your local network, use Tailscale or a reverse proxy to reach it from your phone. Plain HTTP over Tailscale (MagicDNS `.ts.net` domains and `100.64.0.0/10` tailnet IPs) is supported — the traffic is already WireGuard-encrypted.

If the dashboard is behind Cloudflare Access, enable the optional service token on the login screen or in Settings > Connection > Gateway. Conduit stores the client secret in Keychain (scoped to the gateway origin), and injects both Access headers into native authentication requests, WebSocket handshakes, and all in-page WebKit fetches via a document-start user script. Credentials are bound to the gateway URL and cleared when switching to a different host.

**Native OAuth limitation:** service-token headers cannot be attached to the system Safari navigation that opens `/auth/native/authorize`. Native OAuth therefore requires that browser authorization route to be reachable through an interactive Cloudflare policy or without a service-token challenge. The token exchange, refresh, REST, and WebSocket-ticket requests still use the configured service-token headers. A service-token-only challenge in front of the authorize route cannot be bypassed by Conduit and must not silently fall back to embedded Google OAuth.

## Push Notifications

Push notifications require a small relay service because iOS does not allow apps to maintain persistent background connections. The relay source is in the `hermes-conduit-notifier` plugin and the push relay server.

To set up push notifications, install the notifier plugin on your Hermes instance:

```
hermes plugins install kaishi00/hermes-conduit-notifier --enable
hermes gateway restart
```

Then follow the in-app pairing flow under Settings > Notifications.

The app uses a shared relay by default (`push.milim.dev`) so notifications work out of the box with no extra setup. If you prefer to run your own relay, enter its URL under Settings > Notifications > Push relay.

## Building from source

```
git clone https://github.com/kaishi00/hermes-conduit.git
cd hermes-conduit
brew install xcodegen
xcodegen generate
open Conduit.xcodeproj
```

Select your team in Signing & Capabilities, then build and run on your device.

**Requirements:**
- Xcode 16 or later
- iOS 17 SDK
- [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)

## Releasing

See [the iOS release workflow](docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md) for the TestFlight and App Store release process.

## Architecture

Conduit is pure SwiftUI targeting iOS 17+. The project uses xcodegen for Xcode project generation from `project.yml`.

The app connects to the Hermes dashboard WebSocket endpoint (`/api/ws`) after authenticating through the dashboard login page. All RPC calls route through the dashboard, same as the desktop client. The gateway is never contacted directly.

Key files:
- `Conduit/Services/HermesClient.swift` - WebSocket client and RPC layer
- `Conduit/Services/AppState.swift` - Main state management and session lifecycle
- `Conduit/Services/DashboardTicketBridge.swift` - Authentication bridge
- `Conduit/Views/ChatView.swift` - Chat interface with streaming
- `Conduit/Voice/` - Voice pipeline: push-to-talk plus GPT-Live and Gemini Live conversations

## Privacy

Conduit does not collect, transmit, or store your data on any third-party server. All communication goes directly between the app and your own Hermes instance. The only external connection is the optional push relay, which you control and can self-host.

No analytics. No telemetry. No ad frameworks.
